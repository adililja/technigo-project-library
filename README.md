# Library

The goal with this assigment was to make a virtual library based on data-objects from books. At first I hade a lot of ideas that I concretizised on paper. Then I needed to look up a palette to work with and hade a image of the Swedish royal library in mind. I asked ChatGPT along the way to help with the sites features: filtering, sorting, ramdomize book/colors and a seach bar. In this process i learned a lot about JavaScript - in what order to write it and how to declare functions etc, comparing the AIs solutions to others code or my own coding intuition. During the process of making the site interactive I used Codepen as a playground, thats also where i found inspiration and code for the glass buttons (wich i think are very cool).

If I hade more time I would expand this assigment to make a toggle that tramsforms this site to a virtual bookshelf. It could have features/visuals like:

-   Having the books look like backs of books with the rectangular sizes based on number of pages.
-   Sorting on female author/have read/screeded would sort the books on the shelf with a gap to the rest of the books.
-   There could be a feature to add a book to the shelf or to "mark" a book as read.
-   The random button would show a bookcard that looks like the ones on this site with the information displayed. What about a nice looking pop-up animation?

There are two things I realize colud be improved already. That is to make the random-book-card img look better and I would like a small icon in the browser-tag.
